# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

I will be using the following node modules:

*Node-Spotify-API

*Moment

*DotEnv

*Axios- for the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API

Liri will respond to the following commands that I have programmed:

1.concert-this

2.spotify-this-song

3.movie-this

4.do-what-it-says

I have provided an audio/video walk-through of my commands assignment below:
